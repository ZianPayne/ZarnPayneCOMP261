This is an assignment that tested my ability to handle flow network problems. 
This allowed me to handle flows, edges as well as page rank of directed graphs.


More detailed report about assignment and my additional contributions:

Here, my Edmond Karp Implementation contains several new methods:
	- ReturnPathBottleneck:      Finds the backpointers of the next shortest path as well as its bottleneck value
	- UpdateFlows:  	 	     Finds the path and updates all the flows of the relevant edges


My PageRank uses some methods as well:
	- HandleSinks: 		     Takes the sinks identified earlier in the initialisation and distributes pageRank evenly.
	- HandleEdgeContribution:    Takes the contribution of pageRank through an edge and adds it into the cumulative pageRank of an edge.
	- FindPrintInfluentialEdges: Finds the most influential in-edges for a node and prints them along with their total contribuion.

Quick Notes on Challenge:
	- Operates on the idea of examining aggregate pageRanks travelling through the edges. 
	- Measures the edges influence based on the distribution of pageRank scores.
	- After doing some research, this would not be feasible in a real network. This is more of a post-processing approach as it requires
	  the aggregate pageRank to be calculated.
